# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January, 06 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Setup Python environment on Ubuntu and PyCharm IDE, learned about basic Pyton data types like strings, integers, tuples.

**Thoughts:** This is all very basic stuff compared to the other languages I've learned so far, but that is the idea : start from scratch and stick to the plan. I believe this will be the hardest part for me : trying NOT to lose interest.

### Day 2: January, 07 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about lists and their functions and methods, combined with list comprehension. Did some exercises in this comprehension stuff.

**Thoughts:** Scraping for time this evening, with tomorrow going to be even worse (meetup). Planned on rushing, but went against that impulse. Still feels very basic, but I am reading a bit here and there (thanks to anyone suggesting resources online!!!)

### Day 3: January, 08 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Did some excercises with Dictionaries and lookup up some more online resources

**Thoughts:** Time was an issue here because of a meetup meeting, but succeeded nonetheless. However, I've felt a bit 'laggin behind' because of it, I should be way ahead in the learning path.

### Day 3: January, 09 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Went on to learn about functions, variable scopes and control structures

**Thoughts:** Still feels very basic (and probably is), but I have to tough it out before moving on to the more advanced stuff

### Day 4: January, 10 2019

**Today's Progress**: Ditched my old learning resource and started using a new one. Revisited data types, modules and variables

**Thoughts:** I got fed up with my current learning resource (a book, which will remain unnamed :) ). Not that it was bad, but too basic and to top it off, almost everything Python 2. I changed it in favor of a more modern learning resource and am revisiting everything. Might seem like a waste of time, but it was going too slowly for me anyways.

### Day 5: January, 12 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made some good progress, finished Strings and Operaters and expressions

**Thoughts:** Just in time for the day. Had to skip one day because of an event at work. Made up for it today by spending about 3 hours on the basics of Operators, Expressions and Strings

### Day 6: January, 14 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went on to learn and practice Lists and Tuples. Needed some time to re-grasp Slicing

**Thoughts:** Again, had to skip a day because of sports event of my son. Had my laptop with me, but in a room with 60 children, I could not concentrate :). All went well today, except I had to reinvestigate the concept of slicing : it was there somewhere in the back of my head.

### Day 7: January, 15 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went on to learn Dictionaries and Sets.

**Thoughts:** Wow, Sets can be hard to wrap your head around. It this point in time I do not see the added value of them, but we'll soon discover

### Day 8: January, 16 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tackled the Lexical structure of a Python Program and the IF conditional statements

**Thoughts:** I'm making good progress, albeit on a slower tempo than I would've liked.

### Day 9: January, 17 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went on with While loops, did some coding examples and played around with the Itertools module

**Thoughts:** Today I went a bit further than usual (time-wise) and for the first time played around a bit more than traditionally following books. Had my first look at a imported moduled (Itertools), which looks promising

### Day 10: January, 18 2019

**Today's Progress**: Functions, arguments, return values and importing were on the menu today

**Thoughts:** Did this one on the same day as D11, because I just was too tired (so two days work in one day). Went along smoothly, and now we are getting to the very interesting stuff, beyond the basics

### Day 11: January, 19 2019

**Today's Progress**: map, zip and filter functions, Comprehensions and Generators

**Thoughts:** Getting to the fun stuff. Chapter was about performance in Python, but learned quite a few tricks along the way. Learned about map, filter and zip functions for collections and Comprehensions. Finally, called it a day with Generators, where a lot of fun stuff can be done with.

### Day 12: January, 21 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about decorators and Decorator factories

**Thoughts:** I had to ask, didn't I? :). First stop before moving on to OOP are the Decorators and Decorator Factories. They can be challenging to comprehend, mind you.
