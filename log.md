# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January, 06 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Setup Python environment on Ubuntu and PyCharm IDE, learned about basic Pyton data types like strings, integers, tuples.

**Thoughts:** This is all very basic stuff compared to the other languages I've learned so far, but that is the idea : start from scratch and stick to the plan. I believe this will be the hardest part for me : trying NOT to lose interest.
