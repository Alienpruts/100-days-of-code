# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January, 06 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Setup Python environment on Ubuntu and PyCharm IDE, learned about basic Pyton data types like strings, integers, tuples.

**Thoughts:** This is all very basic stuff compared to the other languages I've learned so far, but that is the idea : start from scratch and stick to the plan. I believe this will be the hardest part for me : trying NOT to lose interest.

### Day 2: January, 07 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about lists and their functions and methods, combined with list comprehension. Did some exercises in this comprehension stuff.

**Thoughts:** Scraping for time this evening, with tomorrow going to be even worse (meetup). Planned on rushing, but went against that impulse. Still feels very basic, but I am reading a bit here and there (thanks to anyone suggesting resources online!!!)
