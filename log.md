# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January, 06 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Setup Python environment on Ubuntu and PyCharm IDE, learned about basic Pyton data types like strings, integers, tuples.

**Thoughts:** This is all very basic stuff compared to the other languages I've learned so far, but that is the idea : start from scratch and stick to the plan. I believe this will be the hardest part for me : trying NOT to lose interest.

### Day 2: January, 07 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about lists and their functions and methods, combined with list comprehension. Did some exercises in this comprehension stuff.

**Thoughts:** Scraping for time this evening, with tomorrow going to be even worse (meetup). Planned on rushing, but went against that impulse. Still feels very basic, but I am reading a bit here and there (thanks to anyone suggesting resources online!!!)

### Day 3: January, 08 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Did some excercises with Dictionaries and lookup up some more online resources

**Thoughts:** Time was an issue here because of a meetup meeting, but succeeded nonetheless. However, I've felt a bit 'laggin behind' because of it, I should be way ahead in the learning path.

### Day 3: January, 09 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Went on to learn about functions, variable scopes and control structures

**Thoughts:** Still feels very basic (and probably is), but I have to tough it out before moving on to the more advanced stuff

### Day 4: January, 10 2019

**Today's Progress**: Ditched my old learning resource and started using a new one. Revisited data types, modules and variables

**Thoughts:** I got fed up with my current learning resource (a book, which will remain unnamed :) ). Not that it was bad, but too basic and to top it off, almost everything Python 2. I changed it in favor of a more modern learning resource and am revisiting everything. Might seem like a waste of time, but it was going too slowly for me anyways.

### Day 5: January, 12 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made some good progress, finished Strings and Operaters and expressions

**Thoughts:** Just in time for the day. Had to skip one day because of an event at work. Made up for it today by spending about 3 hours on the basics of Operators, Expressions and Strings

### Day 6: January, 14 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went on to learn and practice Lists and Tuples. Needed some time to re-grasp Slicing

**Thoughts:** Again, had to skip a day because of sports event of my son. Had my laptop with me, but in a room with 60 children, I could not concentrate :). All went well today, except I had to reinvestigate the concept of slicing : it was there somewhere in the back of my head.
